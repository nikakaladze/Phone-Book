1)STRUCT - I used a struct to store the contact information, such as name and phone number.
2) ARRAY - The phonebook is an array that holds multiple contacts.
3)FUNCTIONS - I created several functions to handle different operations:
      3.1) ADDCONTACT:  Adds a contact to the phonebook.
      3.2)DISPLAYCONTACTS:  Displays all the contacts stored in the phonebook.
      3.3)SEARCHCONTACT:  Searches for a contact by name.
      
4) INPUT/OUTPUT - I used scanf and printf functions for reading and printing contact information.
      4.1)SCANF:  Used to take user input for contact details (name and phone number)
      4.2)PRINTF: sed to display the stored contact details (e.g., "Name: John Doe, Phone: 123-456-7890").
